#+TITLE: SEXPML - Symbolic Expression eXtensible Programmable Markup Language

SEXPML is a simple way of using s-expressions to represent
HTML/XML/SAX type elements and documents. It is a is a Lisp based
markup language that is itself extendable, and can be used to generate
markup at compile time and/or run time, depending on the
circumstances.

* Introduction

There are many different ways "to create (X)HTML from
S-expressions. If you've seen one, you've seen them
all... :)"[fn:cwho]. What makes up ~SEXPML~ is as follows.

** Simple Syntax

When incorporating markup in Common Lisp code, it is nice to have
syntax that matches well with CL code. 

To start with, the ~SEXPML:<>~ macro can do a lot on its own.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (asdf:load-system :sexpml)
  (eval (read-from-string "(import '(sexpml:<>))"))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results output code
  (let ((sexpml:*sexpml-output* *standard-output*))
    (<> '(this-is-an-element :with "attribute" "after attribute")
      (<> "Text and Characters just after <> in the source code are inserted, escapsed."
            #\<  #\Newline #\>)
      (eval-when (:compile-toplevel)
        (ignore-errors (<> "anything" else after will error at compile time.)))
      (<> '|QuoteWorks|
        (<> '("asDoes" "a string in a quoted list")
          (<> 'ul
            (let ((text "There are keywords."))
              (<> 'li 
                (<> :text text "..which work for " "a List of any items " '|That are evaluated|
                    (identity #\Newline))))
            (<> 'li (<> '(:unescaped "There is this option. <br>"))))))
      (let ((tag "back-quote"))
        (<> `(,tag :is "one of the" :other "ways")))))
#+END_SRC
*=>*
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
<this-is-an-element with="attribute" after attribute
  >Text and Characters just after &lt;&gt; in the source code are inserted, escapsed.&lt;
&gt;<QuoteWorks
    ><asDoes a string in a quoted list
      ><ul
        ><li
          >There are keywords...which work for a List of any items That are evaluated
</li
        ><li
          >There is this option. <br></li
        ></ul
      ></asDoes
    ></QuoteWorks
  ><back-quote is="one of the" other="ways"></this-is-an-element
>
#+END_SRC
